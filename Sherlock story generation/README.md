## Sherlock Story Generation using Markov Chains
This repository contains code for generating Sherlock Holmes-like stories using Markov chains. Markov chains are a probabilistic model that can be used to generate text based on patterns observed in a given corpus of text.

## How it Works
The code in this repository utilizes Markov chains to analyze a collection of Sherlock Holmes stories and then generate new stories that mimic the style and language of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's iconic detective series.
